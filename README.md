## Blackcoffer Data Visualization Dashboard

This project implements an interactive data visualization dashboard for the Blackcoffer test assignment using the provided `jsondata.json` file.

### Structure
- **backend**: Node.js + Express API server connected to MongoDB, serving filtered and aggregated data for the dashboard.
- **frontend**: Next.js (React + TypeScript) web app that renders the analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filters.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
2. Configure MongoDB and environment variables (to be documented as the implementation progresses).
3. Run backend and frontend:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev` (after scripts are configured)
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

Further setup, scripts, and usage instructions will be expanded as features are implemented.
